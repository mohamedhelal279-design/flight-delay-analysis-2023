This project analyzes flight delays and cancellations using airline datasets.  
The notebook (`my.ipynb`) includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Delay patterns by weekday
- Cancellations and diversions
- Visualizations of delays

How to get the dataset:
If you already have a flight dataset, place it in the project folder and update the notebook path accordingly.  
- Otherwise, you can download open flight datasets from sources such as:
  - [Kaggle Flight Delay Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bordanova/2023-us-civil-flights-delay-meteo-and-aircraft)
